            Hello World! i'm an aspiring software engineer based 
            in Liberia, at least for now. I'm an introvert who 
            enjoys reading and hopefully and progressingly coding.
            my dream is to work at any FAANG company, but the goal
            is Apple. i've realized now that working hard is an
            understatement and i have to give it my all. It's not 
            gonna be easy and the KIT isnt't making it easy either,
            but with a little bit of ambition a master piece is created.
        </p>

            <h1>My Experience at KIT so far

            <p>March 23, 2023 marks my fourth day here at KIT as a student and
                the experience has been stressful but amazing so far, it's an 
                opportunity that don't come around everyday and it should be made
                the most out of. Software engineering has been my dream for a year
                now and it would mean the world to me if i can make it through the
                bridge and the Universe to me if i can get a job at Apple by getting
                through the bridge program.</p>
